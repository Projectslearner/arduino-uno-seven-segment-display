# Arduino Uno Seven Segment Display

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to display numbers from 0 to 9 on a seven-segment display using an Arduino Uno. The seven-segment display will sequentially show each digit for one second.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Seven Segment Display**
- **Resistors (appropriate value for current limiting)**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Seven Segment Display to Arduino Uno:**
   - Segment A: Connect to digital pin 2.
   - Segment B: Connect to digital pin 3.
   - Segment C: Connect to digital pin 4.
   - Segment D: Connect to digital pin 5.
   - Segment E: Connect to digital pin 6.
   - Segment F: Connect to digital pin 7.
   - Segment G: Connect to digital pin 8.
   - Common Cathode/Anode: Connect to GND (for common cathode) or VCC (for common anode) through a current-limiting resistor.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire up the seven-segment display to the Arduino Uno as per the circuit setup section.
   - Ensure the common cathode/anode is connected correctly.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - The seven-segment display will start showing numbers from 0 to 9 sequentially, with each number displayed for one second.

#### Applications

- **Digital Clocks:** Use as a component to display time.
- **Counters:** Implement in projects that require visual counting.
- **Numeric Displays:** Display any numeric information in various projects.

#### Notes

- Ensure the correct value resistors are used to limit current and protect the segments of the display.
- Adjust the pin mappings and display logic for different types or models of seven-segment displays.
- Explore multiplexing techniques for controlling multiple seven-segment displays with fewer pins.
